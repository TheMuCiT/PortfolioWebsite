    "about": "Bakish is the first mobile application I created by myself after I completed more than 5 production-ready applications through tutorials. For this project, I used all my gained knowledge to create an application for the small breed shop. This app is similar to bolt food or uber eats but concentrated in one shop. The design is created with a vision that it can be easily changed for a different shop. In this project, I just react native with typescript. I implemented AWS authentication, and amplify database. For data management, I use Apollo Client. To make it fully work I used a lot of additional packages such as React Navigation, Stripe, Cognito, days, google maps, google place autocomplete, and others.",
